## CodingIxD - Body data project: Balance



# Project Overview
Balance is a project focused on integrating Fitbit data to visually represent both heart rate and stress levels. Our primary objective is to offer a unique and engaging visualization of this data.
This is an interdisciplinary project, we combine the fields of computer science & product design to realise a neoanalogue artifact for the visualization of body data.

If you want to learn more about the design aspects of this project, you can reach out to our product designer, Freia Antonia https://www.instagram.com/freia_antonia/
We hope to create value by creating a neoanalogue artifact that  translates data about the personal stress level and the body data of the heart rate into a pleasing visualisation that is both meaningful and impactful.
The artifact should help users to meditate and gain insight about their mental load. If you want to learn more about our philosophy, go to the "Abstract" file.

Technical Setup:



We have integrated LED lights controlled by a ESP32 足WROOM 足DA. We are exploring the feasibility of individually controlling each LED lamp to represent stress levels. The chosen color range spans from dark blue for calm states to white for high-stress situations.

# Technical Details
Breadbord and jumpers, Microcontroller ESP32, D-MOSFET, LED Strip, Stepper Motor, Resistors 1200 +- 5% and 870 +- 1%

Our prototype is based on a ESP32 足WROOM 足DA micro controller which concurrently handles the translates of the input data (pulse and perceived stress level) to the LED strip as well as the Stepper Motor which are handeling the illumination and movement of our prototype respectively.

# Conclusion
Our overarching goal is to seamlessly merge health data with an engaging and culturally significant visualization. We are enthusiastic about the potential impact of the Balance project and are committed to continuous refinement.
